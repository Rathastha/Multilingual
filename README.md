# Multilingual
captures English speech using a microphone, analyzes its sentiment, translates the recognized text into German, and then speaks out the translated text using text-to-speech. It combines modules like SpeechRecognition, TextBlob, googletrans, and gTTS to demonstrate an end-to-end multilingual voice interface.
